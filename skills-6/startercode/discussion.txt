-------

1)

B) Runtime for contain_letters_in_common:



C) Runtime for letters_in_common:



Stacks and Queues
-----------------


2) Which would be a better data structure for creating a Stack: a Linked List or
   a built-in Python list? Explain why, referencing the runtime requirements for
   Stack operations (push, pop, etc).






3) Which would be a better data structure for creating a Queue: a Linked List or
   a built-in Python list? Explain why, referencing the runtime requirements for
   Queue methods (enqueue, dequeue, etc).



Trees
-----

4) Using the diagram in the instructions, in what order would a Breadth First
   Search (BFS) algorithm visit each node  until finding burritos (starting at
   food)?


5) Using the diagram in the instructions, In what order would a Depth First
   Search (DFS) algorithm visit each node until finding Chicago-style (starting
   at food)?

6) How is a binary search tree different from other trees?
